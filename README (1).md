# Credit-EDA

### Introduction
This case study delves into the application of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in a real-world business scenario, focusing on risk analytics in banking and financial services. The objective is to understand how data can be leveraged to minimize the risk of financial loss while lending to customers.

### Business Understanding
Loan providers often face challenges in assessing loan applications, especially when applicants have insufficient or non-existent credit history. This case study revolves around a consumer finance company specializing in lending various types of loans to urban customers. The company aims to use EDA to analyze patterns in the data and ensure that applicants capable of repaying loans are not rejected.

### Risk Assessment
When evaluating loan applications, the company must consider two types of risks:

<b>Loss of Business:</b> If a potentially creditworthy applicant is rejected, it results in a loss of business.
<b>Financial Loss:</b> Approving loans to applicants likely to default can lead to financial losses.
### Data Description
The dataset includes information about loan applications at the time of applying, categorized into two scenarios:

Clients with Payment Difficulties: Individuals with late payments exceeding a certain threshold on one or more installments.
Others: Cases where payments are made on time.

Decision Types
The loan application process results in four types of decisions:

Approved: Loan application is approved.
Cancelled: The client cancels the application during approval.
Refused: Loan application is rejected by the company.
Unused Offer: Loan is cancelled by the client at various stages.
Business Objectives
The primary goal is to identify patterns indicating clients' difficulty in paying installments, enabling actions such as loan denial, reducing loan amounts, or offering loans at higher interest rates to risky applicants. EDA aims to ensure that creditworthy consumers are not rejected while minimizing the risk of defaults.

### Conclusion
This case study underscores the importance of EDA in mitigating risks associated with loan applications. By understanding consumer attributes and loan characteristics, financial institutions can make informed decisions, safeguarding their interests while serving the needs of creditworthy customers.
